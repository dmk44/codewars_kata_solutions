# Ð¡odewars
Hello, dear friends.
This is where I will store my codewars solutions.

Currently I am training programming languages:

* Python
* JavaScript
* R
* C++
* C#

* SQL database query language.

I keep the solutions for myself so that I can quickly access some code examples.
I recommend that other code warriors look at my solutions only if you have already made enough attempts.

**NOTE:** Codewars does not recommend creating such a repository. If codewars contacts me, I will delete the repo or restrict access.
