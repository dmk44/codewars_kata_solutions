# Codewars Solutions

[RU](README.rus.md)

This repository contains my personal collection of Codewars kata solutions.

I use it as a knowledge base to track my progress and quickly revisit idioms, design ideas, and patterns in different programming languages.

### Languages I'm currently practicing:
- Python
- R
- JavaScript
- Java
- C++
- C#
- Bash (linux terminal script language)
- PowerShell (Windows terminal script language)
- SQL (database query language)

I enjoy exploring different languages out of curiosity and to broaden my engineering perspective — not just learning “one stack for work”, but understanding how ideas translate across ecosystems.

**Important:**  
Codewars does not encourage publishing full solution repositories.  
If Codewars contacts me regarding this repo, I will delete it or restrict access.
